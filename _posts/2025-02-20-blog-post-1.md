(Generated by Deepseek) The development of characteristic classes and their connection to cohomology is a fascinating story that emerged from the interplay between topology, geometry, and algebra. To understand why mathematicians began thinking about cohomology classes on vector bundles to measure properties like "twistedness" or obstructions, we need to delve deeper into the historical and mathematical motivations.

### **Historical Context and Motivations**

#### 1. **Early Topology and Obstructions (1930s–1940s)**  
- **Problem of Vector Fields on Manifolds**: A central question in topology was whether a manifold admits a certain number of linearly independent vector fields. For example, the Poincaré-Hopf theorem relates the number of zeros of a vector field to the Euler characteristic of the manifold.
- **Stiefel-Whitney Classes**: Eduard Stiefel and Hassler Whitney were studying the problem of finding linearly independent sections of a vector bundle. They realized that certain topological obstructions could be encoded in cohomology classes, now called **Stiefel-Whitney classes** $\( w_i \in H^i(M;\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}) \)$. These classes measure whether a bundle admits a certain number of linearly independent sections.
  - For example, $\( w_1(E) = 0 \)$ if and only if the bundle $\( E \)$ is orientable.
  - The top Stiefel-Whitney class $\( w_n(E) \)$ (for a rank-\( $n$ \) bundle) detects whether the bundle admits a nowhere-zero section.

#### 2. **Chern's Work on Complex Bundles (1940s)**
- **Complex Geometry and Curvature**: Shiing-Shen Chern was studying complex vector bundles and their connections to curvature. He discovered that certain curvature invariants could be integrated to yield topological invariants, leading to the definition of **Chern classes** $\( c_i \in H^{2i}(M;\mathbb{Z}) \)$.
  - Chern showed that the Chern classes are independent of the choice of connection, making them purely topological invariants.
  - The Chern-Weil homomorphism formalized this by expressing Chern classes as polynomials in the curvature form $\( \Omega \)$:
 $$c_k(E) = \left[ \text{Tr}\left( \frac{i\Omega}{2\pi} \right)^k \right].$$

#### 3. **Pontryagin's Work on Real Bundles (1940s)**
- **Real Vector Bundles and Orientability**: Lev Pontryagin introduced **Pontryagin classes** $\( p_i \in H^{4i}(M; \mathbb{Z}) \)$ for real vector bundles. These classes are related to the Chern classes of the complexified bundle:
  $$p_k(E) = (-1)^k c_{2k}(E \otimes \mathbb{C}).$$
 - Pontryagin classes are crucial for understanding the topology of real manifolds, especially in dimension 4 (e.g., in the study of 4-manifolds).

#### 4. **Hirzebruch and the Signature Theorem (1950s)**
- **Hirzebruch's Signature Theorem**: Friedrich Hirzebruch unified the study of characteristic classes with his signature theorem, which relates the Pontryagin classes of a manifold to its signature (a topological invariant):
  $$\text{Sign}(M) = \langle \mathcal{L}(p_1, p_2, \dots), [M] \rangle,$$
  where $\( \mathcal{L} \)$ is the Hirzebruch $\( \mathcal{L} \)$-genus.
  - This theorem showed that characteristic classes could encode deep topological information about manifolds.

#### 5. **Grothendieck's Axiomatization (1950s–1960s)**
- **Grothendieck's Functorial Approach**: Alexander Grothendieck reformulated characteristic classes in the language of algebraic geometry, emphasizing their functorial properties. He introduced the notion of **Chern classes for algebraic vector bundles** and showed that they satisfy a universal property in the Grothendieck ring of varieties.
  - This abstract approach allowed characteristic classes to be applied in a wide range of contexts, including algebraic geometry and K-theory.

### **Why Cohomology Classes?**

The choice of cohomology classes to measure properties of vector bundles was motivated by several key insights:

1. **Obstruction Theory**: Cohomology classes naturally arise as obstructions to solving geometric problems. For example:
   - The first Stiefel-Whitney class $\( w_1 \)$ measures the obstruction to orientability.
   - The Euler class $\( e(E) \)$ measures the obstruction to finding a nowhere-zero section of a bundle.

2. **Naturality**: Cohomology classes are functorial, meaning they behave well under pullbacks and maps between spaces. This makes them ideal for studying bundles, which are themselves functorial objects.

3. **Curvature and Topology**: The Chern-Weil homomorphism showed that curvature forms (local geometric data) can be integrated to yield cohomology classes (global topological invariants). This provided a deep link between geometry and topology.

4. **Multiplicative Structure**: The Whitney sum formula for characteristic classes,
  $$c(E \oplus F) = c(E) \smile c(F),$$
  reflects the multiplicative structure of cohomology rings, making them a natural setting for studying vector bundles.

### **Conclusion**

The development of characteristic classes was driven by the need to understand the global properties of vector bundles and manifolds. Cohomology classes emerged as the natural language for encoding these properties because of their ability to measure obstructions, their functoriality, and their deep connections to curvature and topology. From Stiefel and Whitney's early work on obstructions to Grothendieck's abstract formalism, the history of characteristic classes reflects the evolution of modern mathematics itself.
