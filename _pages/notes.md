Geometry and Topology
------

* ### Differential Topology
    * This is the [note](http://MyosotisAlpestris.github.io/files/differential_topology.pdf) I took while studying [this course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo4jXE-LdDTQIrmgxcuLO9w5n6AdiltQo).

* ### Algebraic Topology
    * This is the handwriting note about spectral sequence, taken during [this cource](https://cloverm.folk.ntnu.no/237Spring2020.html). (This file might be a bit large)
